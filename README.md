UPDATE: As of 2026-02-13, it appears that the elements hidden by this userscript are no longer included on the main page layout by Jira by default. Instead, they are added when using the “Improve issue” button which can be hidden using [binki-atlassian-jira-ai-improve-issue-hide](https://github.com/binki/binki-atlassian-jira-ai-improve-issue-hide).

Jira will display an annoying in-page “AI-powered” similar issues lister. This hides that.

This is just some CSS but I don’ t really have a system for deploying fixes like this set up for anything other than Greasemonkey.

[Install](binki-atlassian-jira-ai-banner-hide.user.js?raw=1)
